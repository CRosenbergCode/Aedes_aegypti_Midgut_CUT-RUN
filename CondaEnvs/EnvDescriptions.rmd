AGAT: Basically just the AGAT tool, which can help format GTF/GFF files and deal with them cleanly

CUTRUNTOOLS2.1: Most of the dna side of the CUTRUN pipeline

RNAPseudo: The RNA side of the CUTRUN pipeline (has Trinity, Salmon, and Hisat-2 as aligners)

RNAQC: A few packages for getting qc metrics on RNAseq data, haven't used this one much but was looking at a couple tools

Deeptools_kernel: Basically just deeptools, so dealing with bigwig files for viewing genome data for CUTRUN
