Purpose- SEACR is an alternative to MACS2, MACS2 is more versatile, while SEACR is more highly selective and specifically used for Cut&Run.
Input- BAM
Output- Bed- start/end coordinates of signal/peak

Please note that SEACR requires a different sorting compared to other programs. It only needs to be ran once, but must be run even if .bam files were sorted in another step.
