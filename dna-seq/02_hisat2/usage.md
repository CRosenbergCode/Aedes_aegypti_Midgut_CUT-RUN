Requires the following files: 
If no index: requires a genome fasta file named mergedGenome.fa. This should
be placed in the 02_hisat2 directory.


If there are index files: they should be placed in the hisatIndex directory
and named genomeAedesEColi.ht2.# .

These files can be found in the Rosenberg lab remote storage (RSTOR or NAS) 
under the "Informatics Resources" directory.

In all cases, trimmed and QCed fastq files should be in the 01_fastp/trimmedFastq
directory. They will already be there if you have run the script inside the 
01_fastp directory.
